# Angular Weather #
http://bit.ly/Plunk2

This is a simple example to get you started with AngularJS.
It shows:

* Looping to bound collections in the view (index.html)
* Creating a custom service that uses promises to return data to its caller (weatherService.js)
* Using the $http service with promises to request data from a RESTful web service
